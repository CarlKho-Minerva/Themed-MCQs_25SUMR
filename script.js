                <div class="details-title">Clinical Features:</div><div class="details-content">Most common in older children, young/middle-aged adults. Affects both sexes equally. Usually affects only one bone (polyostotic cases occur). Common bones: clavicle, scapula, humerus, ribs, ilium, ischium, sacrum. May or may not be painful. Begins suddenly, advances rapidly until bone replaced by thin fibrous tissue layer surrounding cavity.</div>
                <div class="details-title">Oral Manifestations:</div><div class="details-content">Destruction of entire mandible in some cases; concomitant maxillary involvement possible. Pain or facial asymmetry. Pathologic fracture following minor trauma. Disturbed eruption pattern of teeth due to loss of normal support.</div>
                <div class="details-title">Histopathology:</div><div class="details-content">Replacement of bone by connective tissue containing many thin-walled blood vessels or anastomosing vascular spaces lined by endothelial cells.</div>

Can be: involving variable number of bones, accompanied by pigmented skin lesions ('cafe-au-lait' spots) = Jaffe's type; OR involving nearly all bones, with skin lesions AND endocrine disturbances = Albright's syndrome (McCune-Albright Syndrome).</div>
                <div class="details-title">Clinical Features:</div><div class="details-content">Manifests early in life. Evident deformity, bowing, or thickening of long bones (often unilateral). Onset insidious, recurrent bone pain common. Bones of face/skull frequently involved -> asymmetry. Other bones: clavicles, pelvic bones, scapulae, long bones, metacarpals, metatarsals. Spontaneous fractures -> invalidism. Skin lesions: irregularly pigmented melanotic 'cafe-au-lait' spots (light brown). Albright's: endocrine disturbances (precocious puberty in females starting 2-3 yrs or younger, vaginal bleeding; pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, ovary issues), intramuscular soft-tissue myxomas.</div>
